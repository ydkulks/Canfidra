## 🧠 My Understanding

Client-1 create offer to connect to Client-2 with their information
(SDP-Session Description Protocol).
SDP is stored in a server which can be read by Client2 to answer the call
with their SDP. This is called Signaling, handled by 3rd party server.

ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) standard help in discovering
their peer's public IP. Both peers create a list of ICE candidates (IP/PORT).
WebRTC will handle this by doing series of request to STUN(Session Traversal
Utilities for NAT) server
